### The VICC participation agreement
If you are working to create cancer variant interpretations and would like to formally join the VICC, please consider signing 
the VICC letter of support. 

Please [contact us](/members/) to discuss further and submit a signed version to the VICC. The text of this agreement can be found here: [VICC_LoS_template.pdf](/assets/docs/VICC_LoS_template.pdf).

### Cancer Variant Knowledgebases
There are now quite a number of high quality cancer variant knowledgebases that aim to document the clinical relevance of individual variants. A growing list of these resources along with some of their features are maintained here: [Cancer Variant Knowledgebase List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a_SLGdB3zCI3xWbws2S1ZvVOsk2gDYlUkpZjd2HdHBo/pubhtml). 

If you believe this list is missing a relevant resource or contains any inaccuracies, please [contact us](/members/).

### Precision medicine initiatives we hope to serve
In addition to the molecular tumor boards at participating institutions with cancer variant knowledgebases the VICC also hope to help provide high quality clinical variant interpretations with any interested precision medicine effort. The following is a selected list of precision medicine efforts and cancer treatment centers we are actively engaged with: 
* [Personalized Oncogenomics Program](http://www.personalizedoncogenomics.org/), BCCA, Vancouver BC.
* [The Charité Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.charite.de/)
