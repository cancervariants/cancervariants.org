[CKB](https://ckb.jax.org/) is a dynamic digital resource for interpreting complex cancer genomic profiles in the context of protein impact, therapies, and clinical trials. CKB CORE is the public access version we have been providing to the community since 2016. CKB CORE contains all the content associated with 50 genes that are commonly found on cancer hotspot panels. New and updated content is pushed out daily and viewable genes are available on a quarterly rotating schedule.
