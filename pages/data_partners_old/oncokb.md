[OncoKB™](https://www.oncokb.org/about) is a precision oncology knowledge base developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that contains biological and clinical information about genomic alterations in cancer.

Alteration- and tumor type-specific therapeutic implications are classified using the [OncoKB™ Levels of Evidence](https://www.oncokb.org/levels) system, which assigns clinical actionability to individual mutational events.

For additional details about the OncoKB™ curation process, please refer to the version-controlled [OncoKB™ Curation Standard Operating Procedure](https://www.oncokb.org/sop). When using OncoKB™, please cite: [Chakravarty et al., JCO PO 2017](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.17.00011).
