The VICC is currently working to launch a virtual tumor board. The purpose of this exercise will be to drive discussions on how to develop new tools, guidelines, standards, ontologies, APIs, best practices, etc. that facilitate clinical interpretation of cancer variants. The idea of using a virtual tumor board was inspired in part by the physical tumor boards of participating institutions as well as the [ASCO University Molecular Oncology Tumor Board](http://university.asco.org/motb). 

If you would like to participate in the Virtual Tumor Board by submitting a hypothetical case or discussing cases with the group, please [contact the VICC](/members/).
