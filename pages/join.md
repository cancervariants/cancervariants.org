### Join the discussion
The VICC holds bi-weekly calls of all participants. These meetings serve several purposes:
- Update presentations from the VICC working groups.
- Presentations from existing cancer knowledgebases. These presentations help to increase awareness of otherwise siloed 
 efforts. Each presentation is followed by discussion of developing standards, ontologies, and APIs.
- Input from industry partners and other interested parties.
- Discussion of ongoing VICC projects.
- Planning for grant submissions to support the work of VICC.

Everyone is welcome to join these calls. If you would like to join, please:
