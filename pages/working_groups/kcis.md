## About KCIS
This working group focuses on the landscape of variation interpretation standards, the salient data elements informing those standards, and how those elements are curated. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the development of guidelines to be followed and the appropriate contexts for which they should be used.

This group meets on the first Wednesday of every month, from 11a-12p US Central Time. If you are interested in following these and other VICC calls, please add the [public VICC Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=aG9xYmVrZWY0ODJpODJxY2hvZDM0aWNmbGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
