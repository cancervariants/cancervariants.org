## About VR&S

This working group is focused on requirements, strategies, standards, and tools for variant representation and search across the VICC knowledgebases. This work is in partnership with the GA4GH [Genomic Knowledge Standards workstream](https://ga4gh-gks.github.io/) and the ClinGen [Somatic Working Group](https://clinicalgenome.org/working-groups/somatic/).

This group meets on the second Thursday of every month, from 3-4p US Central Time. If you are interested in following these and other VICC calls, please add the [public VICC Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=aG9xYmVrZWY0ODJpODJxY2hvZDM0aWNmbGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
