## About ISP
This working group will focus on methods for the _in-silico_ prediction of biological consequences of cancer variants, and practices for evaluating robustness and confidence of these predictions. Ultimately, this focus should lead to guidelines, standards, and tools in support of the use of these predictions as evidence for variant clinical significance classification.

This group meets on an _ad hoc_ basis. To receive updates specific to ISP, including call details and agenda, please [join the ISP mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vicc-isp-wg) (follow link and click the blue "Join Group" button).
