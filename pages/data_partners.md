## Current Partners
* [CIViC](https://civicdb.org/welcome) is a community-edited forum for discussion and interpretation of peer-reviewed publications pertaining to the clinical relevance of variants (or biomarker alterations) in cancer. These interpretations may include associations between molecular alterations (or lack of alteration) and one or more drugs, diagnoses, prognoses or other treatment decisions. These interpretations of clinical significance (or lack of clinical significance) are purely for research purposes. A finding of no interpretation does not necessarily indicate lack of relevance for any specific variant or biomarker alteration. Interpretations are not presented in ranked order of potential or predicted importance.These interpretations make no promise or guarantee of any clinical benefit (or lack of clinical benefit).

* [Molecular Oncology Almanac (MOAlmanac)](https://moalmanac.org/about) is a clinical interpretation algorithm paired with an underlying knowledge base for precision oncology. The primary objective of MOAlmanac is to identify and associate molecular alterations with therapeutic sensitivity and resistance as well as disease prognosis. This is done for “first-order” genomic alterations -- individual events such as somatic variants, copy number alterations, fusions, and germline -- as well as “second-order” events -- those that are not associated with one single mutation, and may be descriptive of global processes in the tumor such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, mutational signatures, and whole-genome doubling.

    The underlying database of this method is dependent on expert curation of the current body of knowledge on how molecular alterations affect clinical actionability. As the field of precision oncology grows, the quantity of research on how specific alterations affect therapeutic response and patient prognosis expands at an increasing rate. Curating the latest literature and presenting it in an accessible manner increases the abilities of clinicians and researchers alike to rapidly assess the importance of a molecular feature.

* [OncoKB™](https://www.oncokb.org/about) is a precision oncology knowledge base developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that contains biological and clinical information about genomic alterations in cancer.

    Alteration- and tumor type-specific therapeutic implications are classified using the [OncoKB™ Levels of Evidence](https://www.oncokb.org/levels) system, which assigns clinical actionability to individual mutational events.

    For additional details about the OncoKB™ curation process, please refer to the version-controlled [OncoKB™ Curation Standard Operating Procedure](https://www.oncokb.org/sop). When using OncoKB™, please cite: [Chakravarty et al., JCO PO 2017](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.17.00011).

* [The Jackson Lab Clinical Knowledgebase](https://ckb.jax.org/) is a dynamic digital resource for interpreting complex cancer genomic profiles in the context of protein impact, therapies, and clinical trials. CKB CORE is the public access version we have been providing to the community since 2016. CKB CORE contains all the content associated with 50 genes that are commonly found on cancer hotspot panels. New and updated content is pushed out daily and viewable genes are available on a quarterly rotating schedule.
