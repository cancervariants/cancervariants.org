Angshumoy Roy is the Medical Director of Cancer Genomics in the Division of Genomic Medicine, Department of Pathology at Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH). Angshumoy has directed the development and implementation of clinical genomic testing at TCH on several different platforms including targeted NGS oncology and hereditary cancer panels, as well as RNAseq and exome sequencing jointly with the Human Genome Sequencing center at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM).


As a board-certified molecular genetic pathologist, Angshumoy has served or currently serving as lead co-investigators on several pediatric genomics studies, including the implementation of clinical genomic testing for the NHGRI/NCI ‘Texas KidsCanSeq’ Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) project at TCH and BCM. He is also an active member of several professional committees and workgroups within the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and currently co-chairs the Pediatric Cancer Taskforce and the NTRK Fusions somatic Variant Curation Expert Panel at ClinGen. He is at present also serving as a member of the Molecular Review Committee (MRC) for the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH trial, having served in the past as a member of the Sequencing platform/analysis committee for the trial.

His research interests are in the development and implementation of clinical genomic testing in pediatric cancers. Angshumoy has co-authored over 60 peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, reviews, and received the 2016 Enid Gilbert Barness award from the Society for Pediatric Pathology in recognition of his study on the genomics of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.
