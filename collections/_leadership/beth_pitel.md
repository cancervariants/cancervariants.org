Beth Pitel works as a Clinical Variant Scientist in the Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics with an emphasis of oncology at Mayo Clinic.  Beth has helped develop clinical genetic testing using several different testing modalities including NGS oncology panels, RNAseq, Mate Pair sequencing, chromosomal microarray, and qPCR. Beth is the lead on the Genomics of Oncology Annotation Team (GOAT) at Mayo Clinic, which creates interpretive resources for the laboratory based on current knowledgebase content, database content, commercial oncology NGS assays, and prevalent literature. She is also part of the clinical interpretation and reporting work group.

Beth has worked at Mayo Clinic since 2007 and completed her masterâ€™s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular biology in 2015 with foci on cancer biology and bioinformatics at the Mayo Graduate School. Her interpretation worked has led to several presentations and webinars for various well-known entities. Additionally, Beth has developed publically available knowledgebase tutorials, a publicly-available Cancer Variant Knowledgebases Tutorial video, and has given an introduction to genomic knowledgebase workshop at the Association of Genetic Technologists/American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science joint annual meeting. Beth is an active member of the Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC), an affiliate member of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and has contributed to the ClinGen Somatic Working Group in addition to her involvement in the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) as a co-director and a virtual molecular tumor board co-lead.
Beth has co-authored over 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts and is frequently involved in clinical and translational research in the Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory within the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.
