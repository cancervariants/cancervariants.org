Somatic variants in cancer-relevant genes are interpreted from multiple partially overlapping perspectives. When 
considered in discovery and translational research endeavors, it is important to determine if a particular variant 
observed in a gene of interest is oncogenic or not, as such knowledge provides the foundation on which targeted cancer 
treatment research is based. In contrast, clinical applications are dominated by diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic 
variant classification which in part also depends on underlying variant oncogenicity. The Association for Molecular Pathology, 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the College of American Pathologists (AMP/ASCO/CAP) have published 
structured somatic variant clinical classification guidelines which specifically address diagnostic, prognostic, and 
therapeutic implications. These guidelines have been well-received by the oncology community. Many variant 
knowledgebases, clinical laboratories/centers have adopted or are in the process of adopting these guidelines. The 
AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines also describe different data types which are used to determine oncogenicity of a variant, such 
as: population frequency, functional data, computational predictions, segregation, and somatic frequency. A second 
collaborative effort created the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Scale for Clinical Actionability of 
molecular targets to provide a harmonized vocabulary that provides an evidence-based ranking system of molecular 
targets that supports their value as clinical targets. 

However, neither of these clinical guideline systems provide systematic and comprehensive procedures for aggregating 
population frequency, functional data, computational predictions, segregation, and somatic frequency to consistently 
interpret variant oncogenicity, as has been published in the ACMG/AMP guidelines for classification of pathogenicity 
of germline variants. In order to address this unmet need for somatic variant oncogenicity classification procedures, 
the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC, a GA4GH driver project) Knowledge Curation and Interpretation 
Standards (KCIS) working group (WG) has developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with contributions from members 
of ClinGen Somatic Clinical Domain WG, and ClinGen Somatic/Germline variant curation WG using an approach similar to 
the ACMG/AMP germline pathogenicity guidelines to categorize evidence of oncogenicity as very strong, strong, moderate 
or supporting. This SOP enables consistent and comprehensive assessment of oncogenicity of somatic variants and latest 
version of an SOP can be downloaded below.
